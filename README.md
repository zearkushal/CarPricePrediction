# Car Price Prediction

**Car Price Prediction** is a machine learning project designed to estimate the price of a car based on key vehicle attributes. The project utilizes **Linear Regression** and includes thorough **data cleaning and preprocessing** to ensure accurate predictions.

## Features Used

The model predicts car prices based on the following features:  

- **Body Type** – the type of car body (e.g., sedan, hatchback)  
- **Mileage** – total distance the car has traveled  
- **Engine Volume (EngineV)** – engine capacity in liters  
- **Year of Manufacture** – the year the car was produced  

## Libraries Used

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:  

- **NumPy** – for numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for visualizing data trends and distributions  
- **Statsmodels** – for statistical modeling and regression analysis  
- **Scikit-learn** – for building and evaluating machine learning models
